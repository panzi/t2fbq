t2fbq
=====

Unpack, list and mount Trine 2 .fbq archives.

Basic usage:

	t2fbq.py list <archive>                              - list contens of .fbq archive
	t2fbq.py unpack <archive>                            - extract .fbq archive
	t2fbq.py mount <archive> [archive]... <mount-point>  - mount archive as read-only file system

The `mount` command depends on the [llfuse](https://code.google.com/p/python-llfuse/)
Python package and the `unpack` and `mount` commands depend on the
[lzf](https://github.com/teepark/python-lzf) Python package. If these packages are not
available the rest is still working.

This script is compatible with Python 2.7 and 3 (tested with 2.7.5 and 3.3.2).

File Format
-----------

Byte order is little endian and the character encoding of file names seems to
be ASCII (or ISO-8859-1/UTF-8 that coincidentally only uses ASCII compatiple
characters).

Data might be compressed using the LZF compression algorithm.

Basic layout:

 * File Header
 * Index Records
 * Data Records

### File Header

	Offset  Size  Type      Description
	     0     4  uint32_t  version (2)
	     4     4  uint32_t  number of entries
	     8     4  uint32_t  size of index

### Index Record

	Offset  Size  Type      Description
	     0     N  char[N]   null terminated absolute file name ('/' is path separator)
	     N     4  uint32_t  data offset relative to end of index
	   N+4     1  bool      not compressed flag (1 if data is not compressed, 0 if compressed)
	   N+5     4  uint32_t  uncompressed size
	   N+9     4  uint32_t  compressed size
	  N+13     4  uint32_t  chceksum of unknown algorithm?
